# Multivendor E-Commerce Platform (MERN Stack)

## 1. Introduction
This project is a multivendor e-commerce platform built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with Socket.IO for real-time chat between customers and sellers.
The goal was to design a scalable application that allows multiple sellers to list and manage their products, while customers can browse, purchase, and pay securely.  

An admin panel was also developed to manage sellers, customers, and transactions.  

This project simulates real-world e-commerce platforms such as **Amazon, Flipkart, or Daraz**, and was built as a mega practice project to strengthen full-stack development skills.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional e-commerce projects are usually single-vendor systems where only the platform owner manages products. Such systems lack scalability and limit product diversity.  

**The problem solved here:**
- Sellers need their own dashboards to manage shops and products.  
- Customers should have a smooth shopping experience with carts, wishlists, and secure checkouts.  
- Admins need central control over sellers and transactions.
- Communication between buyers and sellers is key for trust.

A multivendor e-commerce system solves all these challenges by supporting multiple roles and features.  

---

## 3. Objectives
- Build a full-stack e-commerce platform with role-based access (**Customer, Seller, Admin**).  
- Provide a seamless customer experience (browse, cart, checkout, payments).  
- Create a dedicated seller dashboard for product and order management.  
- Develop an admin control panel to manage users, sellers, and transactions.  
- Integrate payment gateways for secure transactions.
- Provide real-time chat between sellers and customers using Socket.IO.
- Deploy the project with cloud services for real-world accessibility.

At a high level, the system follows a client-server architecture:  

- **Frontend (React):** Handles UI/UX for customers, sellers, and admin.  
- **Backend (Node/Express):** Provides REST APIs for authentication, product management, order processing, and payments.  
- **Database (MongoDB):** Stores user, product, order, and payment data.  
- **Socket.IO:** Enables real-time communication.
- **Payment Gateway (Stripe/PayPal):** Processes secure transactions.

## 8. Workflows
 

**Customer Checkout Flow**  
1. Customer adds product to cart  
2. Customer places order → Backend processes  
3. Payment request sent to Stripe/PayPal  
4. Payment confirmation returned  
5. Order saved in database


## 8. Workflows (System Sequence Diagrams)

### 🛍 Customer Checkout Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Customer
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant PaymentGateway
    participant Database

    Customer ->> Frontend: Add product to cart
    Customer ->> Frontend: Place order
    Frontend ->> Backend: Send order request
    Backend ->> PaymentGateway: Initiate payment
    PaymentGateway -->> Backend: Payment confirmation
    Backend ->> Database: Save order + payment
    Backend -->> Frontend: Order confirmation
    Frontend -->> Customer: Show success message

```

**Seller Product Management Flow**  
1. Seller logs in → accesses dashboard  
2. Adds/updates/deletes products  
3. Backend updates database  
4. Products instantly visible to customers

**Real-Time Chat Flow**
1. Customer opens product page → initiates chat with seller
2. Socket.IO establishes a connection
3. Messages exchanged in real-time
4. Messages stored in database for history

**Admin Seller Approval Flow**  
1. Seller requests approval  
2. Admin reviews request  
3. Admin approves/rejects seller  
4. Seller status updated in database

## 9. Challenges & Solutions
- **Role-based authentication:** Handled using JWT with role verification middleware.  
- **Database design for sellers/products:** Created relational mapping in MongoDB (seller ↔ products).  
- **Payment gateway integration:** Implemented Stripe for secure payments and fallback with PayPal.  
- **Scalability concerns:** Modularized backend routes and used Redux for scalable state management.  
- **Deployment issues:** Used Netlify for frontend, Render for backend, and MongoDB Atlas for database.
