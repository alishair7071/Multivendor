1. Introduction

This project is a multivendor e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The goal was to design a scalable application that allows multiple sellers to list and manage their products, while customers can browse, purchase, and pay securely. An admin panel was also developed to manage sellers, customers, and transactions.

This project simulates real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, or Daraz, and was built as a mega practice project to strengthen full-stack development skills.

2. Problem Statement

Traditional e-commerce projects are usually single-vendor systems where only the platform owner manages products. Such systems lack scalability and limit product diversity.

The problem solved here:

Sellers need their own dashboards to manage shops and products.

Customers should have a smooth shopping experience with carts, wishlists, and secure checkouts.

Admins need central control over sellers and transactions.

A multivendor e-commerce system solves all these challenges by supporting multiple roles and features.

3. Objectives

Build a full-stack e-commerce platform with role-based access (Customer, Seller, Admin).

Provide a seamless customer experience (browse, cart, checkout, payments).

Create a dedicated seller dashboard for product and order management.

Develop an admin control panel to manage users, sellers, and transactions.

Integrate payment gateways for secure transactions.

Deploy the project with cloud services for real-world accessibility.

4. Tech Stack

Frontend:

React.js (UI framework)

Redux Toolkit (state management)

React Router (navigation)

Tailwind CSS (styling)

Backend:

Node.js & Express.js (REST API development)

MongoDB with Mongoose (NoSQL database)

Authentication & Security:

JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication

Bcrypt for password hashing

Payments:

Stripe (card payments)

PayPal (alternative gateway)

Deployment:

Netlify (frontend)

Render/Heroku (backend)

MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

5. System Architecture

üìç [Diagram Placeholder ‚Äì will be added later]

At a high level, the system follows a client-server architecture:

Frontend (React): Handles UI/UX for customers, sellers, and admin.

Backend (Node/Express): Provides REST APIs for authentication, product management, order processing, and payments.

Database (MongoDB): Stores user, product, order, and payment data.

Payment Gateway (Stripe/PayPal): Processes secure transactions.

6. Features

7. Database Schema (Entities)

üìç [Class/ER Diagram Placeholder ‚Äì will be added later]

Main Entities:

User (id, name, email, role, passwordHash)

Seller (id, shopName, userId, products[])

Product (id, name, price, stock, sellerId, category)

Order (id, customerId, productIds, status, paymentId)

Payment (id, orderId, method, status, amount)

Relationships:

One seller ‚Üí many products

One customer ‚Üí many orders

One order ‚Üí many products

One order ‚Üí one payment

8. Workflows

üìç [Sequence Diagrams Placeholder ‚Äì will be added later]

Customer Checkout Flow

Customer adds product to cart

Customer places order ‚Üí Backend processes

Payment request sent to Stripe/PayPal

Payment confirmation returned

Order saved in database

Seller Product Management Flow

Seller logs in ‚Üí accesses dashboard

Adds/updates/deletes products

Backend updates database

Products instantly visible to customers

Admin Seller Approval Flow

9. Challenges & Solutions

Role-based authentication: Handled using JWT with role verification middleware.

Database design for sellers/products: Created relational mapping in MongoDB (seller ‚Üî products).

Payment gateway integration: Implemented Stripe for secure payments and fallback with PayPal.

Scalability concerns: Modularized backend routes and used Redux for scalable state management.

Deployment issues: Used Netlify for frontend, Render for backend, and MongoDB Atlas for database.

10. Results & Learnings

Built a fully functional multivendor e-commerce platform.

Learned end-to-end development with MERN stack.

Gained experience with real-world workflows like seller onboarding, payment integration, and admin approval systems.

Improved understanding of authentication, authorization, and database relationships.

Strengthened deployment and project structuring skills.

11. Future Improvements

Add real-time chat between customers and sellers.

Implement recommendation engine (ML-based).

Introduce coupon codes and discounts.

Expand analytics dashboard for sellers and admin.

Add microservices for scalability.

12. Conclusion

This multivendor e-commerce platform successfully replicates real-world marketplace functionality with separate roles for customers, sellers, and admin. The project demonstrates proficiency in the MERN stack, authentication, payments, and scalable architecture, making it a solid showcase for professional portfolios.
